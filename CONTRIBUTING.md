# Contributing to goAuthly

We welcome contributions! Please follow these rules to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## Branch Naming Rules

Use descriptive branch names with a prefix:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation updates
- `refactor/` for code refactorings

Example: `feature/oauth-support`

## No Unsolicited Features

Please open an issue to discuss any new features before submitting a pull request. Unsolicited features may be rejected to maintain project focus and quality.

## Small PRs

Keep pull requests focused and small. Large, sweeping changes are difficult to review and more likely to contain bugs. Each PR should address a single issue or implement a single feature.

## Clear Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow the standard format:
- A short summary (max 50 characters)
- An optional detailed description after a blank line

Example:
```
Add OAuth token verification logic

This commit implements the initial OAuth 2.0 token verification
logic as described in issue #123.
```
